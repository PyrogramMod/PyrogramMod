Migrating the account to another data center
============================================

This question is asked by people who find their account always being connected to one DC (data center), but are
connecting from a place far away, thus resulting in slower interactions when using the API because of the greater
physical distance between the user and the associated DC.

When registering an account for the first time, is up to Telegram to decide which DC the new user is going to be
created in. It's also up to the server to decide whether to automatically migrate a user in case of prolonged usages
from a distant location.

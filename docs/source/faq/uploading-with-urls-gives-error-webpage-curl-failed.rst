Uploading with URLs gives error WEBPAGE_CURL_FAILED
===================================================

When uploading media files using an URL, the server automatically tries to download the media and uploads it to the
Telegram cloud. This error usually happens in case the provided URL is not publicly accessible by Telegram itself or the
media file is too large. In such cases, your only option is to download the media yourself and upload it from your
local machine.

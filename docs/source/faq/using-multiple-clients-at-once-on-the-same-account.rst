Using multiple clients at once on the same account
==================================================

Both user and bot accounts are able to run multiple sessions in parallel. However, you must not use the same session
in more than one client at the same time. The correct way to run multiple clients on the same account is by authorizing
your account (either user or bot) from the beginning each time, and use one separate session for each parallel client.

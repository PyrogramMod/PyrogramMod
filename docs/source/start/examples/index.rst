Examples
========

This page contains example scripts to show you how Pyrogram looks like.

Every script is working right away (provided you correctly set up your credentials), meaning you can simply copy-paste
and run. The only things you have to change are session names and target chats, where applicable.

The examples listed below can be treated as building blocks for your own applications and are meant to be simple enough
to give you a basic idea.
